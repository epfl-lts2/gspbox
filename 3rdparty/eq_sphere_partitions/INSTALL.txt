Installation
============
This toolbox is organized into a number of directories. To use it effectively,
these directories need to be on your Matlab path every time you start Matlab.
You will therefore need to install the toolbox before using it.

To do this,
1. You need to unzip the file eqsp-1.10.zip into the directory
   where you want the toolbox to reside. This will create the subdirectory
   eq_sphere_partitions.

   On Linux, Unix and Mac OS X, to perform the unzip, run the GNU unzip command
       unzip eqsp-1.00.zip
   On Mac OS X, as an alternative, you can use:
       Stuffit Expander (free): http://www.stuffit.com/mac/expander/index.html
   On Windows, use one of:
       7-zip (free):            http://www.7-zip.org
       Winzip (commercial):     http://www.winzip.com

2. Run Matlab, change directory to eq_sphere_partitions and then run
   install_eq_toolbox.

The function INSTALL_EQ_TOOLBOX adds the directories of this toolbox to your
Matlab path by changing the contents of the Matlab file pathdef.m. Here is the
result of HELP INSTALL_EQ_TOOLBOX. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 INSTALL_EQ_TOOLBOX Install using Toolbox Installer, with sensible defaults

 Syntax
  install_eq_toolbox(arg);

 Description
  INSTALL_EQ_TOOLBOX uses Toolbox Installer to install this toolbox. It must
  be run from the top level directory of this toolbox, which must contain the
  file info.ins.

  If INSTALL_EQ_TOOLBOX is called with no argument, it asks the user for
  confirmation before taking any action.

  INSTALL_EQ_TOOLBOX first checks if the file pathname.m exists on the current
  Matlab path and can be appended to.
  If so, it asks the user for confirmation and then simply calls the INSTALL
  function of Toolbox Installer to update the file pathname.m.
  If not, it tries to choose a sensible directory in which to create a new
  pathdef.m file, and suggests this to the user before proceeding.

  INSTALL_EQ_TOOLBOX DIRNAME, that is INSTALL_EQ_TOOLBOX('DIRNAME'),
  calls INSTALL('DIRNAME'), using DIRNAME as the directory for pathdef.m.

  INSTALL_EQ_TOOLBOX -, that is INSTALL_EQ_TOOLBOX('-'), calls INSTALL('-'),
  which displays a dialog box so the user can select the directory to be used
  for pathdef.m.

 Notes
  If it is necessary to create a new pathdef.m file, the directory which
  INSTALL_EQ_TOOLBOX suggests to the user for this file defaults to
  the directory which contains startup.m, if this exists.

  Otherwise INSTALL_EQ_TOOLBOX suggests the following directory to the user:
  For Unix systems including Linux and Mac: $HOME/matlab
  For Windows systems: [matlabroot '\toolbox\local'].
  If this directory does not exist, INSTALL_EQ_TOOLBOX tries to create it.

 Examples
  > install_eq_toolbox
  Info: Installer will create the file /c/leopardi/matlab/pathdef.m
  Proceed (y/n)? y
  Info: Installer has created the directory /c/leopardi/matlab
  Info: Installed.

  > install_eq_toolbox
  Info: Installer will update the file /c/leopardi/matlab/pathdef.m
  Proceed (y/n)? y
  Info: Installed.

  > install_eq_toolbox
  Info: Installer will update the file /c/leopardi/matlab/pathdef.m
  Info: Proceed (y/n)? n

  > cd ~
  > install_eq_toolbox
  ??? Error using ==> install_eq_toolbox
  Please run install_eq_toolbox from toolbox directory, eg. /c/leopardi/[...]

Uninstallation
==============
This toolbox also provides an uninstallation command. The function
UNINSTALL_EQ_TOOLBOX removes the toolbox directories from the path, and saves
the updated path to pathdef.m. Note that UNINSTALL_EQ_TOOLBOX does not undo
everything done by INSTALL_EQ_TOOLBOX. In particular, UNINSTALL_EQ_TOOLBOX does
not delete pathdef.m or its directory, even if these were created by
INSTALL_EQ_TOOLBOX.

For more details, see HELP UNINSTALL_EQ_TOOLBOX (in lower case).

Installing other Matlab toolboxes or upgrading Matlab
=====================================================
Since INSTALL_EQ_TOOLBOX may create the file pathdef.m, you will need to be
careful when installing other Matlab toolboxes or upgrading Matlab.
In particular, you will need to ensure that your Matlab path is set correctly.

If things go badly wrong and you can't fix the problem in any other way,
try the following steps:

1. Use UNINSTALL_EQ_TOOLBOX to uninstall this toolbox.
2. If you know that INSTALL_EQ_TOOLBOX created the file pathdef.m
   then delete this file.
3. Install the other Matlab toolboxes or upgrade Matlab.
4. Run INSTALL_EQ_TOOLBOX again.
